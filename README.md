Project Odin; Project Recipes

This project will be about putting my HTML knowledge to the test. I'm going to make a standard simple website with a frontpage and several pages for different recipes.

The skills I need to show on the project are:
- Boilerplate HTML
- Images on the page
- Hyperlinks on the page
- Videos on the page
- Linking different pages to the index.html (relative and absolute links)
- Orderd and unorderd lists

This list is for self reflection when the project is finished.
